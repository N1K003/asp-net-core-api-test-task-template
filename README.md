# Long story short
Your collegue got sick. Unfortunatelly, the company will have a custommer demo tomorrow.

The only way to save face is to finish features prior scheduled demo.

# Tasks

The manager asks you to make every effort finishing this in time.

* First thing you need to do is to finish all TODO from code
* Second thing is to write an API code to create a new user
* Third task is to add method to get users who will have birthday on the next 7 days from tomorrow
* The last thing you need to do is to make the project build and run under the docker (modify docker file)

As it is just a demo you don't need to include any data source and make use of DummyUsersCollection.cs

## Additional information information:
### The tasks 1-3 is a must!

The fourth task is needed by your DevOps team to deploy API to DEMO environmet, but if it is not possible to accomplish this task - it's not a problem, we'll show it from the msvs debug. (Fourth task is optional, good to have).

## Make sure the code is working !!

# When you finish
Copy code to your repository, make it public and send a link to your contact person.

## Thanks and good luck!
